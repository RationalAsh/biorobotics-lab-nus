This project is to answer to the call to solve a pressing need of the National Environment Agency (NEA), which is looking for robotics technology to reduce or replace manpower in drainage inspection. Our proposal was selected due to our novel robot design, sensing and detection algorithm, and most importantly, our overall operation concept. This project will start in March 2016. This funding scheme aims to develop high technology readiness level (TRL8) for practical system development that will be commercialized after the funding. An industry partner will participate in the project from the start and the technology will be licensed to the company after the project.
