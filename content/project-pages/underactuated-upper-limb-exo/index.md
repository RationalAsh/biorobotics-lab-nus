This project aims to develop an underactuated upper limb exoskeleton (UULE) and virtual reality (VR) environment for chronic stroke patients in symmetric and asymmetric bimanual activities of daily living (ADL) training. Some experiments have been conducted to verify UULE's functionality, and the testing results will be published in the future.
