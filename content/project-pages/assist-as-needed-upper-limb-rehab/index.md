A human-robot interaction evaluation-based assist-as-needed (AAN) method is proposed to perform upper limb rehabilitation with the multi-joint Series Elastic Actuator (SEA)-driven robot. Firstly, in order to stabilize the SEA-level dynamics, singular perturbation theory is adopted to design a fast timescale controller. Secondly, for the robot-level dynamics, an iterative learning algorithm is adopted for impedance adaption according to the task performance and human intention. The interaction force feedback is introduced for human-robot interaction evaluation, and the intensity of robotic assistance will be adjusted periodically according to the evaluation results. The proposed method adapts to the subjectâ€™s intention and encourages higher participation by decreasing impedance learning strength and increasing allowable motion error. It can fit the participants with different injured levels and provide adaptive assistance when a specific trainee tries to change his/her participation during rehabilitation. The performance of the AAN method was validated with an experimental study involving a healthy subject.
