This study introduces a portable Unilateral Elbow-Forearm Exoskeleton (UEFE) for aiding chronic stroke patients in daily tasks. With essential degrees of freedom (eF/E and eR), UEFE facilitates elbow flexion/extension and forearm pronation/supination. A distinguishing feature is its emphasis on forearm rotation assistance, an overlooked aspect in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) support. UEFE's lightweight design employs Series Elastic Actuators (SEA) and Bowden cables for safety and efficiency. Notably, an artificial intelligence-based intention recognition system enhances control.
