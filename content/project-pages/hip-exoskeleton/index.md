A novel hip exoskeleton with a single rotary actuator for walking assistance. The device contains only one rotary actuator to drive the two hip joints. A differential cable-driven system, which contains a novel rotary differential mechanism, cable guides, and tensioning mechanism, is applied to achieve this. Hence, the device is lightweight and able to provide balance but inverse assistance to the two hips while allowing independent hip movement. Considering safety, compliance, and the requirement of detecting and regulating interactive torque, we adopt a rotary series elastic actuator (SEA) as the driving unit. The springs array of the SEA can absorb impact and its deflection, which is sensible, indicates the interaction force facilitating accurate torque control. Experience results show good torque control performance and enough response speed to catch up with the walking rhythm.
