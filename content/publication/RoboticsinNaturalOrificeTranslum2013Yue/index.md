#     "abstract": "Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is the latest surgery paradigm in \nwhich the abdominal cavity is accessed via the body's natural orifice, e.g., vagina, mouth, etc. \nCompared with traditional laparoscopic surgery, NOTES completely eliminates the skin incision and \ntherefore benefits the patients in several aspects such as less post-operative pain, shorter recovery \nperiod, fewer complications, etc. Due to the unique characteristics of NOTES, instruments for traditional \nlaparoscopic surgery are not suitable for NOTES and hence novel hardware design is necessary for facilitating \nsystem development. This paper gives an overview of the state of the arts in the development of surgical \ninstruments for NOTES, particularly with a focus on the promising robotic endoscopes.",
