 abstract = {Natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is the latest surgery paradigm in 
which the abdominal cavity is accessed via the body's natural orifice, e.g., vagina, mouth, etc. 
Compared with traditional laparoscopic surgery, NOTES completely eliminates the skin incision and 
therefore benefits the patients in several aspects such as less post-operative pain, shorter recovery 
period, fewer complications, etc. Due to the unique characteristics of NOTES, instruments for traditional 
laparoscopic surgery are not suitable for NOTES and hence novel hardware design is necessary for facilitating 
system development. This paper gives an overview of the state of the arts in the development of surgical 
instruments for NOTES, particularly with a focus on the promising robotic endoscopes.},
