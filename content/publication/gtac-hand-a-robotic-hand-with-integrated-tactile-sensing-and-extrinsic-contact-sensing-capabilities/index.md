abstract: In many interaction and manipulation tasks, robots need to estimate
  the state or properties, such as extrinsic contact states (ECSs), on the
  object being manipulated. Tactile sensing is an essential sensor modality for
  robots to acquire this relevant information. In this article, we present a
  robotic hand integrated with tactile sensors that combine two force sensing
  principles as skin-like heterogeneity, piezoresistive, and Hall effect, and
  can obtain normal and shear contact force feedback simultaneously from the
  fingers and palm, resulting in 285 tactile sensing measurements at a rate of
  150 Hz. In the contact-rich manipulation task, there would be complicatedly
  coupled contact relationships between the robotic hand and the grasped objects
  during external contact. Sectionwise features (SWFs) are implemented to
  leverage these tactile features by means of incorporating distributed forces,
  and acquiring the dynamic time-varying rate and tactile events. A quantitative
  evaluation of the performance of recognizing nine ECSs is provided such as
  99.6% accuracy and the SWFs resulted in a significant reduction (30%) in the
  error rates. Given the human-like tactile sensing integration design and
  high-quality real-time models of patterning and learning, the robotic hand can
  perform challenging tasks, such as delicate object grasping, object handovers,
  and ball-hit recognition.
