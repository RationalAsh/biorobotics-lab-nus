abstract: Series elastic actuators (SEAs) have been the most popular compliant
  actuators as they possess a variety of advantages, such as high compliance,
  good backdrivability, and tolerance to shocks. They have been adopted by
  various rehabilitation robots to provide appropriate assistance with suitable
  compliance during human–robot interaction. For a multijoint SEA-driven
  rehabilitation robot, a big challenge is to develop an assist-as-needed (AAN)
  method without losing stability during uncertain physical human–robot
  interaction. For this purpose, this article proposes a human–robot interaction
  evaluation-based AAN method for upper limb rehabilitation robots driven by
  SEAs. First, in order to stabilize the SEA-level dynamics, singular
  perturbation theory is adopted to design a fast time-scale controller. Second,
  for the robot-level dynamics, an iterative learning algorithm is adopted for
  impedance adaption according to the task performance and human intention. The
  interaction force feedback is introduced for human–robot interaction
  evaluation, and the intensity of robotic assistance will be adjusted
  periodically according to the evaluation results. The stability of human–robot
  interaction is provided with the Lyapunov method. Finally, the proposed
  rehabilitation method is constructed and implemented on a
  two-degree-of-freedom SEA-driven robot. It handles the uncertain interaction
  in such a principle that correct movements will lead to less assistance for
  encouraging participation and incorrect movements will lead to more assistance
  for effective training. The proposed method adapts to the subject's intention
  and encourages higher participation by decreasing impedance learning strength
  and increasing allowable motion error. It can fit the participants with
  different motor capabilities and provide adaptive assistance when a specific
  trainee tries to change his/her participation during rehabilitation. The
  performance of the AAN method was validated with experimental studies
  involving healthy subjects.
