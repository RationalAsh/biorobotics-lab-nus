abstract: Compliant actuator has considerable merits for safe robot control.
  Although the control problem of robotic manipulators with compliant actuators
  has been extensively investigated in recent years, limited result is presented
  for optimal trajectory tracking control. The reason is that a complex and
  time-consuming learning procedure is needed for solving the
  Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation in real time and it is difficult to
  reproduce for practical engineering systems. This work proposes an inverse
  optimal adaptive neural control scheme to remove such limitation. A tuning
  functions-based adaptive learning mechanism, which aims for boosting the
  control efficiency and providing a simple control implementation, is proposed
  to update the inverse optimal controller. It is proved that optimal
  performance is achieved with respect to a meaningful cost functional and the
  tracking error ultimately converges to a tunable residual around zero. Both
  simulations and experiments are carried out to validate the established
  results. It is the first time that experimental results are provided for
  inverse optimal adaptive control.
