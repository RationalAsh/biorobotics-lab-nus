 abstract = {We developed a lightweight lower-limb exoskeleton to assist the paretic leg of stroke patients during gait training. The 
device features compliant actuators separated from the patient’s limb, thus avoiding any gait disruption caused by the actuators’ inertia. 
The exoskeleton control uses motion data from the healthy leg to extract a reference gait phase. In this context, phase is a continuous 
variable that tracks the progress of the gait over one cycle and wraps around at the end of the cycle. The extracted phase information is 
used to time the assistive torque acting on the impaired leg. Control of the assistive torque is implemented as a force control acting on 
a time-varying linear system representing the actuator and exoskeleton. Results from one experiment show how the exoskeleton helps improve 
knee flexion during the swing phase of the gait cycle.},
