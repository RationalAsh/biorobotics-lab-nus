#     "abstract": "We developed a lightweight lower-limb exoskeleton to assist the paretic leg of stroke patients during gait training. The \ndevice features compliant actuators separated from the patient\u2019s limb, thus avoiding any gait disruption caused by the actuators\u2019 inertia. \nThe exoskeleton control uses motion data from the healthy leg to extract a reference gait phase. In this context, phase is a continuous \nvariable that tracks the progress of the gait over one cycle and wraps around at the end of the cycle. The extracted phase information is \nused to time the assistive torque acting on the impaired leg. Control of the assistive torque is implemented as a force control acting on \na time-varying linear system representing the actuator and exoskeleton. Results from one experiment show how the exoskeleton helps improve \nknee flexion during the swing phase of the gait cycle.",
