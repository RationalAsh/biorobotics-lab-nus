abstract: With inherent mechanical compliance and programmable force
  controllability, the Series Elastic Actuator (SEA) has been a popular choice
  for modern mechanical systems. It is crucial to realize accurate and robust
  force control for a SEA, especially in a physical human–robot interaction
  condition. In this paper, a model-free force controller (MFFC) for the SEA is
  developed, which relies only on the input–output measurement. Firstly, based
  on the ultra-local model concept, the SEA force dynamics is reformulated in a
  simpler way, and all unknown terms are grouped as one term called lumped total
  disturbance. Secondly, an enhanced extended stated observer (EESO) is designed
  to simultaneously estimate the lumped total disturbance, the force velocity,
  and the control input gain. Thirdly, a disturbance rejective intelligent PD
  (iPD) control scheme is established. In addition, the effects of the control
  input gain are analyzed and the close-loop stability is demonstrated with
  Lyapunov method. The control accuracy and robustness of the MFFC are verified
  in a physical human–robot interaction environment.
