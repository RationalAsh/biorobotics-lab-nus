#     "abstract": "Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is one of the most common joint diseases in adults worldwide. Most KOA patients suffer from medial knee joint pain, since the ground reaction force passes the knee joint medially in the frontal plane during walking, compressing the medial part. Existing conservative treatments attempt to reduce the medial knee joint contact force \n(MKF) by reducing the external knee adduction moment (EKAM). However, the efficacy of these methods is still debatable. MKF is not only dominated by EKAM whereas external knee flexion moment and knee muscle activity also play important roles. Passive knee braces and powered exoskeletons have demonstrated their potential to change knee muscle activity during walking. \nThis thesis aimed to evaluate the activity of muscles related to the medial knee joint loading under different knee exoskeleton assistance conditions.An exoskeleton was developed to deliver knee extension and abduction assistance solely or together during the stance phase of walking. Five healthy male subjects were enrolled in the experiments with 5 conditions tested: \nFree Walking (FW), Zero Force (ZF), Extension Assistance Alone (EXT), Abduction Assistance Alone (ABD), and Combined Extension and Abduction Assistance (EA). Electromyography (EMG) signals of 6 muscles vastus lateralis (VL), vastus medialis (VM), biceps femoris (BF), semimembranosus (SM), gastrocnemius medialis (GM), and soleus (SL)] were collected while the subjects \nwalked on a treadmill under different conditions. Multiple EMG-based indices for the medial knee joint loading were then calculated.Compared to FW, GM activation (p = 0.039), GM-to-SL activation ratio (p = 0.032), and VM-SM co-contraction duration (p = 0.025) were significantly reduced under ZF. Relative to ZF, EXT caused a significant reduction in the VL activation \n(p = 0.035) and a declining trend in the co-contraction level of the lateral and medial knee muscles. ABD had little effects on the EMG-based indices as compared to ZF.These results indicate that in the view of muscle activity, the exoskeleton fastening (ZF), along with the sole knee extension assistance, affords the potential to unload the medial knee joint, while \nthe knee abduction assistance may not be necessary. Further research will evaluate EMG-based indices as well as gait kinematics and kinetics (EKAM and EKFM) on more subjects.",
