abstract: Working overhead for long periods of time is a difficult task that
  often places a high workload on the shoulder and leads to injury. Occupational
  exoskeletons are an emerging technology that is gaining momentum in the
  construction and manufacturing industries, as they can reduce workload and
  improve work efficiency. The purpose of this article is to provide an
  up-to-date overview of the various exoskeletons that have been developed to
  support “overhead” tasks that require prolonged or repetitive lifting of the
  arms. The article presents the current state of development of these
  technologies, focusing on the different types of actuators, mechanical
  structures, and sensing/control strategies. We assess their feasibility and
  highlight challenges that are considered barriers to large-scale adoption of
  industrial exoskeletons. Based on these results, we identify and analyze the
  design criteria and considerations in manufacturing exoskeletons for overhead
  work that can contribute to the further development of exoskeletons for
  shoulder support.
