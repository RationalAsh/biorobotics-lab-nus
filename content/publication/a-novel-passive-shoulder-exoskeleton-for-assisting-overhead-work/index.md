abstract: Shoulder exoskeletons (SEs) can assist the shoulder joint of workers
  during overhead work and are usually passive for good portability. However,
  current passive SEs face the challenge that their torque generators are often
  attached to the human arm, which adds a significant amount of weight to the
  user’s arms, resulting in additional energy consumption of the user. In this
  paper, we present a novel passive SE whose torque generator is attached to the
  user’s back and assists the shoulder joint through Bowden cables. Our approach
  greatly reduces the weight on the user’s arms and can accommodate complex
  shoulder joint movements with simple and lightweight mechanical structure
  based on Bowden cables. In addition, to match the nonlinear torque
  requirements of the shoulder joint, a unique spring-cam mechanism is proposed
  as the torque generator. To verify the effectiveness of the device, we
  conducted a usability test based on muscle activations of 10 healthy subjects.
  When assisting overhead work, the SE significantly reduced the mean and
  maximum electromyography signals of the shoulder-related muscles by up to 25%.
  The proposed SE contributes to further research on passive SE design to
  improve usability, especially in terms of reducing weight on human arms.
