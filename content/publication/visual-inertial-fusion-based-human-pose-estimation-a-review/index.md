abstract: Human pose estimation provides valuable information for biomedical
  research on human movement and applications, such as entertainment and
  physical exercise. The fusion of visual and inertial data has been
  increasingly studied in the past two decades to take advantage of these two
  naturally complementary sensing modalities. In this article, we systematically
  reviewed the advances in visual–inertial fusion-based human pose estimation
  with a thorough search for related studies in five mainstream literature
  databases. A total of 54 studies were identified and included by screening
  4586 records retrieved in the review process. The estimation targets, hardware
  design, fusion methods, evaluation metrics, and system accuracy of these
  included studies were summarized and categorized for analysis. From these
  state-of-the-art studies, challenges in terms of mobility, calibration,
  real-time estimation, and evaluation methods are further discussed in depth
  and possible directions to overcome these issues are recommended. We expect
  that this systematic review can provide researchers and engineers with a
  thorough idea of the progress and performance in visual–inertial fusion-based
  human pose estimation. We also hope that the discussions on challenges and
  possible future directions can facilitate future work to improve such systems
  and promote their applications in real life.
