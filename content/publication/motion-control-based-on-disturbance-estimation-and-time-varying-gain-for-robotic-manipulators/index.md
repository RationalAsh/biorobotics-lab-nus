abstract: To achieve high-accuracy manipulation in the presence of unknown
  dynamics and external disturbance, we propose an efficient and robust motion
  controller (named TvUDE) for robotic manipulators. The controller incorporates
  a disturbance estimation mechanism that utilizes reformulated robot dynamics
  and filtering operations to obtain uncertainty and disturbance without
  requiring measurement of acceleration. Furthermore, we design a time-varying
  control input gain to enhance the control system's robustness. Finally, we
  analyze the boundness of the control signal and the stability of the
  closed-loop system, and conduct a set of experiments on a six-DOF robotic
  manipulator. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of TvUDE in
  handling internal uncertainty and external static or transient disturbance.
