 abstract = {It is challenging to accurately perform liver intervention procedures such as biopsy and ablation in clinical practice, where the target (a tumor, usually) is moving during the treatment due to respiratory liver motion and deformation. Such motion makes both imaging, and locating of the target area, more difficult. In this thesis, three aspects in particular are focused on, namely image processing, phantom study, and experimental study, to develop new techniques and look for practical solutions to this problem. Specifically, we apply respiratory signal extraction and 4D liver modeling, dynamic liver phantom evaluation, ex-vivo and in-vivo biopsy testing, and hybrid schemes to improve biopsy efficiency and accuracy. In the first part of the thesis, a new approach providing fast and robust extraction of respiratory signal from real-time ultrasound images is introduced to identify the respiratory phase of the liver. This approach is able to achieve accurate motion estimation within several seconds, and thus demonstrates its suitability as a build-in respiratory motion-tracking algorithm for the US image-guided biopsy robotic system. Moreover, a novel method for generating a subject-specific and respiration-corrected 4D ultrasound liver model is described, to visualize and analyze liver motion during respiration. This method creates a sequence of respiration-corrected 3D image volumes, to capture liver motion, and hence to provide subject-specific preoperative information to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and treatment. Second, a novel dynamic liver phantom, which can be applied as a liver motion simulator, is presented for the development and validation of an image-guided biopsy system. By tracking the marker position inside the phantom, we found this dynamic phantom capable of providing stable and repeatable movement cycles to simulate subject-specific respiration under different settings of parameters. This phantom reduces the reliance on living subjects, and at the same time also reduces the potential harmful effects of tested devices on living subjects. Third, to obtain ideal testing objects for the US image-guided biopsy study, a unique Vaseline-based technique, for easy creation of simulated tumors of different sizes inside porcine livers, is proposed. Its performance was investigated in ex-vivo and in-vivo biopsy studies. This technique provides practical solutions to the problem of a lack of ideal testing objects, and has value in terms of application in any biopsy-related study, such as biopsy training, biopsy imaging, and biopsy needle function testing and so on. In addition, a supplementary work on quantitative evaluation of vascular segmentations in liver images is illustrated, because analysis of vascular structure from volumetric datasets plays a crucial role in many clinical applications, including biopsy. Though this work was based on automatic segmentation results from patientsâ€™ CT datasets, it is worth mentioning that this method is also suitable for vessel segmentations from US volume data as well.},
