#     "abstract": "Deep neural networks are powerful machine learning approaches that have exhibited excellent results on many classification \ntasks. However, they are considered as black boxes and some of their properties remain to be formalized. In the context of image \nrecognition, it is still an arduous task to understand why an image is recognized or not. In this study, we formalize some properties \nshared by eight state-of-the-art deep neural networks in order to grasp the principles allowing a given deep neural network to classify \nan image. Our results, tested on these eight networks, show that an image can be sub-divided into several regions (patches) responding \nat different degrees of probability (local property). With the same patch, some locations in the image can answer two (or three) orders \nof magnitude higher than other locations (spatial property). Some locations are activators and others inhibitors (activation-inhibition \nproperty). The repetition of the same patch can increase (or decrease) the probability of recognition of an object (cumulative property). \nFurthermore, we propose a new approach called Deepception that exploits these properties to deceive a deep neural network. We obtain for \nthe VGG-VDD-19 neural network a fooling ratio of 88\\%. Thanks to our \"Psychophysics\" approach, no prior knowledge on the networks \narchitectures is required.",
