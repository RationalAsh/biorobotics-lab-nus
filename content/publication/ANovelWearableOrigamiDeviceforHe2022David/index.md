#     "abstract": "Older adults have a frail bone structure and neurological system, making them more prone to falls than the rest of the \npopulation. Falls can lead to head and cervical spine injuries, which are critical since they involve life-threatening surgeries or \nparalysis. The current solution is to build a wearable protection device to absorb the fall-related forces and prevent head and \ncervical spine injuries. Nevertheless, current wearable protection systems solely shield the lower-limbs. This work\u2019s main idea is \nto propose a wearable origami device for head and cervical spine protection in falls. The device is foldable, compact, and lightweight; \nthus, it can be worn by the subject at any point in time. The device uses a Logistic Regression-based fall detection algorithm coupled \nwith a speech recognition system that detects the fall event and deploys the origami structure to shelter the subject\u2019s head and cervical \nspine. The free-fall experiments show that the origami\u2019s maximum deformation along the vertical direction is 4cm, the Logistic \nRegression-based algorithm can detect the fall event with an F1-score of 77.45 \\%, and the speech recognition can distinguish the subject\u2019s \nshouting with an accuracy of 88.5 \\%. Furthermore, the entire system can deploy in less than 800ms, which is adapted to protect subjects \nfrom head and cervical spine injuries.",
