abstract: Optimizing a performance objective during control operation while also
  ensuring constraint satisfactions at all times is important in practical
  applications. Existing works on solving this problem usually require a
  complicated and time-consuming learning procedure by employing neural
  networks, and the results are only applicable for simple or time-invariant
  constraints. In this work, these restrictions are removed by a newly proposed
  adaptive neural inverse approach. In our approach, a new universal barrier
  function, which is able to handle various dynamic constraints in a unified
  manner, is proposed to transform the constrained system into an equivalent one
  with no constraint. Based on this transformation, a switched-type auxiliary
  controller and a modified criterion for inverse optimal stabilization are
  proposed to design an adaptive neural inverse optimal controller. It is proven
  that optimal performance is achieved with a computationally attractive
  learning mechanism, and all the constraints are never violated. Besides,
  improved transient performance is obtained in the sense that the bound of the
  tracking error could be explicitly designed by users. An illustrative example
  verifies the proposed methods.
