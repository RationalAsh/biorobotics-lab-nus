abstract: The human sense of touch enables us to perform delicate tasks on
  deformable objects and/or in a vision-denied environment. To achieve similar
  desirable interactions for robots, such as administering a swab test, tactile
  information sensed beyond the tool-in-hand is crucial for contact state
  estimation and contact force control. In this letter, a tactile-guided
  planning and control framework using GTac, a hetero G eneous Tac tile sensor
  tailored for interaction with deformable objects beyond the immediate contact
  area, is proposed. The biomimetic GTac in use is an improved version optimized
  for readout linearity, which provides reliability in contact state estimation
  and force tracking. A tactile-based classification and manipulation process is
  designed to estimate and align the contact angle between the tool and the
  environment. Moreover, a Koopman operator-based optimal control scheme is
  proposed to address the challenges in nonlinear control arising from the
  interaction with the deformable object. Finaly, several experiments are
  conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. The
  experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can accurately
  estimate the contact angle as well as achieve excellent tracking performance
  and strong robustness in force control.
