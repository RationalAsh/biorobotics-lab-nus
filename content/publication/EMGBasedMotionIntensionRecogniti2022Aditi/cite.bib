 abstract = {Many upper limb exoskeleton have been developed to assist stroke patients, but the use of electromyography signal as a control input remains unexplored. In this work, the usability of EMG based motion intention recognition methods in controlling an upper limb exoskeleton has been explored. EMG data was captured for two upper limb movements, i.e., elbow flexion-extension and forearm pronation-supination. The developed motion onset detection algorithm resulted in sensitivity and specificity > 90%. While the motion direction estimation algorithm has precision, recall and F1-score > 95%.
To evaluate the feasibility of the scheme for real-life application, it was deployed on a microcontroller board and integrated with upper limb exoskeleton hardware. The exoskeleton was tested using Fittsâ€™ law-based target acquisition tasks. The completion rate was 100% for all the iterations.
The results suggest that EMG-based motion intension recognition can effectively control the upper limb exoskeleton for aiding activities of daily living.},
