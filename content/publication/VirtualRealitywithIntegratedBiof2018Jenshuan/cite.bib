 abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) game with integrated biofeedback is developed in this project. It is designed as an additional intervention in a robot-assisted gait therapy. Fourteen healthy individuals are recruited to validate the feasibility and usability of the virtual reality intervention. The experiments are conducted with three configurations: virtual reality, non-virtual reality and retention trial. Significant differences found in the outcomes of the trials suggest that the VR game with integrated biofeedback has the potential to improve the motor function outcome compared to the result in the non-VR trial. Furthermore, none of the participants reported nauseous feelings during the trials, be it with or without VR.},
