 abstract = {An actuator is a device that accomplishes the actuation, which is defined as the process of converting some form of 
energy into mechanical force and motion. To control the actuator, it is important to use sensor technology to get positioning or 
force information. This paper is focused on an approach to measure the force for a class of compliant actuators. The proposed 
approach uses a potentiometer and Hooke's law to calculate output force. Since the noise is found in potentiometer sensor, a 
low-pass filter is proposed to overcome this problem. The advantage of the proposed force estimation approach is that it is based 
on the cheap potentiometer, and it does not require the force sensor. Experimental test is given to verify the effectiveness of 
the proposed approach.},
