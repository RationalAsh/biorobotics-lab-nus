#     "abstract": "The ladar range image has received considerable attentions in the automatic target recognition field. However, previous \nresearch does not cover target recognition using log-polar ladar range images. Therefore, we construct a target recognition system \nbased on log-polar ladar range images in this paper. In this system combined moment invariants and backpropagation neural network \nare selected as shape descriptor and shape classifier, respectively. In order to fully analyze the effect of log-polar sampling pattern \non recognition result, several comparative experiments based on simulated and real range images are carried out. Eventually, several \nimportant conclusions are drawn: (i) if combined moments are computed directly by log-polar range images, translation, rotation and \nscaling invariant properties of combined moments will be invalid (ii) when object is located in the center of field of view, recognition \nrate of log-polar range images is less sensitive to the changing of field of view (iii) as object position changes from center to edge \nof field of view, recognition performance of log-polar range images will decline dramatically (iv) log-polar range images has a better \nnoise robustness than Cartesian range images. Finally, we give a suggestion that it is better to divide field of view into recognition \narea and searching area in the real application.",
