 abstract = {The ladar range image has received considerable attentions in the automatic target recognition field. However, previous 
research does not cover target recognition using log-polar ladar range images. Therefore, we construct a target recognition system 
based on log-polar ladar range images in this paper. In this system combined moment invariants and backpropagation neural network 
are selected as shape descriptor and shape classifier, respectively. In order to fully analyze the effect of log-polar sampling pattern 
on recognition result, several comparative experiments based on simulated and real range images are carried out. Eventually, several 
important conclusions are drawn: (i) if combined moments are computed directly by log-polar range images, translation, rotation and 
scaling invariant properties of combined moments will be invalid (ii) when object is located in the center of field of view, recognition 
rate of log-polar range images is less sensitive to the changing of field of view (iii) as object position changes from center to edge 
of field of view, recognition performance of log-polar range images will decline dramatically (iv) log-polar range images has a better 
noise robustness than Cartesian range images. Finally, we give a suggestion that it is better to divide field of view into recognition 
area and searching area in the real application.},
