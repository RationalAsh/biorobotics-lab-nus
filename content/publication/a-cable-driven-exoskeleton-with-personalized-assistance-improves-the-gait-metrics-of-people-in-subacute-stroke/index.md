abstract: Most stroke survivors have mobility deficits and show a pathological
  gait pattern. Seeking to enhance the gait performance among this population,
  we have developed a hybrid cable-driven lower limb exoskeleton (called SEAExo
  ). This study aimed to determine the effects of SEAExo with personalized
  assistance on immediate changes in gait performance of people after stroke.
  Gait metrics (i.e., the foot contact angle, knee flexion peak, temporal gait
  symmetry indices) and muscle activities were the primary outcomes to evaluate
  the assistive performance. Seven subacute stroke survivors participated and
  completed the experiment with three comparison sessions, i.e., walking without
  SEAExo (served as baseline) and without/with personalized assistance, at their
  preferred walking speeds. Compared to the baseline, we observed increases in
  the foot contact angle and knee flexion peak by 70.1% ( p<0.05 ) and 60.0% (
  p<0.05 ) with personalized assistance. Personalized assistance contributed to
  the improvements in temporal gait symmetry of more impaired participants (
  p<0.05 ), and it led to a 22.8% and 51.3% ( p<0.05 ) reduction in the muscle
  activities of ankle flexor muscles. These results demonstrate that SEAExo with
  personalized assistance has the potential to enhance post-stroke gait
  rehabilitation in real-world clinical settings.
