 abstract = {As life expectancy extends, the incidence and prevalence of stroke are expected to increase largely. Stroke causes brain structural and functional loss and leaves permeant disability that results in huge socio-economic burdens. Understanding the brain mechanisms underlying stroke is thus imperative for the prevention, diagnosis, and development of novel rehabilitation approaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including structural and functional MRI as well as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), provides a powerful tool for examining structures and functions in the brain. Various studies using MRI have reported brain plasticity following stroke in terms of structural remodeling of neuronal connections and functional coupling between brain regions at rest and during task performance.However, several gaps have remained. Firstly, the relationship between brain functional network reconfiguration from rest to task in patients with stroke is largely unknown. Secondly, little is known regarding brain white matter microstructural alterations in terms of free water and tissue compartments following stroke. Thirdly, how stroke influences the integrity of brain structural covariance networks, the covarying pattern of inter-regional morphological characteristics such as gray matter volume, underlying different cognitive functions has not been thoroughly studied. Finally, there is a lack of studies that investigate stroke lesion-based phenotype and its association with cognitive performance.To cover these gaps, this thesis adopted a network-based approach to understand interactions between brain regions in terms of motor and cognitive functions following stroke. The first two studies in the thesis investigated the brainmotor relationshipsin chronic subcortical stroke patients. Task-free and motor taskbased functional MRI, as well as their spatial similarity of brain functional network architecture in chronic subcortical stroke patients, were investigated in the first study. Compared to healthy controls, greater functional connectivity disruptions in higher-order cognitive networks such as default mode and dorsal attention networks as task demands increased and lower task-related spatial similarity between somatomotor, subcortical, and cognitive networks in stroke patients, which were associated with motor recovery, were noted. In the second study, white matter abnormalities following chronic subcortical stroke and their association with motor recovery and rehabilitative effect of a brain-computer interface-assisted motor imagery (MI-BCI) training combined with real/sham transcranial direct current stimulation were examined using conventional DTI and free-water (FW) imaging method in chronic subcortical stroke patients. Widespread reduction of fractional anisotropy (FA) and free-water corrected tissue compartment (FAT) but increased ipsilesional FW were found in stroke patients. Higher FA and FAT in forceps minor and ipsilesional cingulate gyrus were associated with motor gains after MI-BCI training. Interestingly, FW increased after MI-BCI training + real/sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Aside from motor impairment, post-stroke cognitive decline is also extensively documented and plays an important role in the quality of life. The third and fourth studies utilized data-driven approaches to investigate the association between structural covarying patterns and stroke lesionbased phenotypes as well as cognitive performance, respectively. Using partial least squares to derive structural covariance networks, subacute ischemic stroke associated with widespread degeneration of higher-order structural brain networks and degradation of these structural brain networks contributed to longitudinal domain-specific cognitive dysfunction were shown in the third study. Lastly, using multi-modal latent Dirichlet allocation, latent factors reflecting ischemic stroke lesion-based phenotype associated domain-specific cognitive function were revealed. Longitudinal changes of these latent factors in stroke patients shifting towards the pattern expressed more in healthy subjects were also observed. Taken together, these studies advance knowledge on how stroke shapes motor recovery via brain functional networks and white matter microstructure, and characterize cognitive performance/decline per structural covariance network and stroke lesions, which can facilitate future strategies for prognosis and post-stroke rehabilitation.},
