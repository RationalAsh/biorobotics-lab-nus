abstract: Upper body kinematics is essential for motor function assessment and
  robot-assisted rehabilitation training. Wearable sensor systems, such as
  inertial measurement units (IMUs), provide affordable solutions to replace
  laboratory-based motion capture systems for use in daily life. However, the
  sensor-to-segment calibration often relies on predefined posture or movements,
  which is hard to perform accurately, particularly for patients with a limited
  range of motion. A visual–inertial sensor system is presented, which includes
  three sensor modules attached to the trunk, upper arm, and forearm. Each
  module has an IMU and an ArUco marker, which can be captured by a camera and
  the driftless orientation of the modules is computed from visual–inertial
  fusion. The sensor-to-segment transformations are calibrated from a period of
  arbitrary arm movements in either a 2-D plane or 3-D space, simulating the
  training process assisted by end-effector robots. Experiments were conducted
  to validate the feasibility and evaluate the accuracy of the proposed method.
  The estimated shoulder and elbow joint angles correlated well ( > 0.986) with
  the ground truth from the optical motion capture (OMC) system. The joint
  angles presented low root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) ( <4∘ ) except for the
  forearm pronation–supination angle (9.34°), which relied on manual alignment.
  The sensor system provides a simple and easy-to-use solution for movement
  assessment during robot-assisted training.
