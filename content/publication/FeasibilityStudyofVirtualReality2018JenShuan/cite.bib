 abstract = {Virtual reality (VR) game with integrated biofeedback is developed for a robot-assisted gait therapy. Fourteen healthy individuals are recruited to validate the feasibility and usability of the virtual reality intervention. Significant differences are found in the outcomes of the trials suggesting that the VR game with integrated biofeedback has the potential to improve the motor function outcome compared to the result in the non-VR trial.},
