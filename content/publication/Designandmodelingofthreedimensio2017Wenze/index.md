#     "abstract": "In the streak tube laser imaging system, there are two conflicts: the first is between high spatial resolution and \nwide field of view (FOV). The second is between high temporal resolution and deep depth of field (DOF). In this paper, a new \nnon-scanning streak tube laser imaging system is presented. A microlens array with three different apertures is used to non-uniformly \ncollect data from the image plane so the conflict between high spatial resolution and wide FOV is relieved and the detectable range \nof system is also increased. A remapping fiber optics with special design is used to realign the image plane on the two photocathodes \nof streak tubes to realize the operation mode of the two streak tubes so the conflict between high temporal resolution and deep DOF is \nrelieved. The mathematical model of the entire imaging system is established based on the range equation. The structure parameters of \nthe receiving optical system are optimized in order to achieve the optimal utilization rate of light energy. In the third, three \nsimulated contrast experiments are organized, and the experiment results demonstrate that the imaging system proposed in this paper \npossesses properties of higher spatial resolution, wider FOV, higher temporal resolution, deeper DOF, and larger detectable range.",
