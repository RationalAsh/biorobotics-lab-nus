      subtitle: 'Wearable Exoskeletons'
      text:  |
        > Making headway in wearable technology, our lightweight, battery-operated exoskeletons—alongside lightweight passive exoskeleton options—provide precise joint assistance for elderly care, outdoor activities, and industrial workers. They combine advanced sensors and adaptive algorithms with core technologies developed in-house to deliver on-demand support that feels natural and unobtrusive. Beyond mobility support, the platform integrates intelligent mobility aids and health-monitoring devices to track user status and optimise interventions. Together with intelligent robots, these solutions aim to improve quality of life and enhance productivity across healthcare, logistics, and industrial settings.
