        > Bio-inspired mobile robots have potential applications in search and rescue missions, surveillance, and environmental monitoring. These robots are able to perform different functions, such as walking, running, or crawling, and flying. Our research focuses on exploring the intrinsic mechanical properties of animal muscles, joints, and skeletal structures to achieve novel robotic actuator and structure design for better performance. We also like study the neural and sensory motor control of biological system for better sensing and control of these robots.
