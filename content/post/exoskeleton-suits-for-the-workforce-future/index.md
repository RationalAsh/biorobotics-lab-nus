title: "Exoskeleton Suits For The Future Workforce"
subtitle: ""
summary: "As populations age, we need solutions that are able to balance productivity and ensure the health and safety of our workers.

Enter XOdian.
 
SGInnovate is working with a team of engineers from National University of Singapore that have devised modular exoskeleton frames to help alleviate the physical stresses of repetitive work. “The idea is to protect our workers from when they are young,” said Professor Haoyong YU, “to prevent them from having long-term upper body or back injuries.”
 
Together with support from our venture-building team, XOdian is looking to launch their company and bring this disruptive product to market. Look out for more news about them on the horizon.
