subtitle: "A robust robotics support system"
summary: "We developed a novel active back support exoskeleton to reduce muscle fatigue and prevent injury on the lower back during lifting tasks. The team's work was published in IEEE Transactions on Robotics on 9 November 2023. This innovation aligns with the broader goal of creating human-centric robotic systems that enhance safety and efficiency in the workplace. Our work made waves behind the scenes of the 2024 National Day Parade (NDP) packing operations. By integrating such assistive technologies, the risk of work-related musculoskeletal disorders could be reduced while boosting both productivity and wellbeing in the workforce."
