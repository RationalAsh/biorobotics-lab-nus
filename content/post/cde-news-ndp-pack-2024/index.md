title: "CDE exoskeletons support National Day packing preparations"
subtitle: ""
summary: "The prototype exoskeletons were developed by NUS Biorobotics Lab at the Department of Biomedical Engineering. These suits assist with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks.

Solidiers used them for packing 300,000 National Day Parade packs. The exoskeletons have been trialed with baggage handlers at Changi Airport and chemical plant workers.

'With more societies facing the challenging of an ageing population, we need to start protecting our workers against injury whilst they are young,' says Assoc Prof Yu Haoyong.
