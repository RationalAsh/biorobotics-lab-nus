Gabriel received a Bachelor’s degree in Electromechanical Engineering from Universidad Panamericana, Mexico City, in 1990. He worked as a design and process engineer for the automotive industry in Mexico, and was instructor in undergraduate mechanics. He received an M.S. from Carnegie Mellon University in 2001, and worked as researcher in mechatronics, design and manufacturing at Universidad Panamericana, 2001-2003. He received a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, in 2009. Gabriel was a Lecturer at the University of Technology, Sydney (UTS) with a research appointment at the UTS Centre for Autonomous Systems.
Gabriel’s research interests include robotics for human mobility assistance and rehabilitation, control theory, dynamics of bipedal walking, physical human-robot interaction, and manipulator programming by demonstration. He joined the Department of Biomedical Engineering in 2016.
