Dr David Carmona-Moreno completed his Classes Préparatoires aux Grandes Écoles in 2013 at the Centre International de Valbonne to prepare the concours aux Grandes Écoles. Then, he continued his education at the Grande École:  École Nationale Supérieure d’Ingénieurs de Sud-Alsace (Groupe Institut National des Sciences Appliquées), where he graduated in 2016 with a Diploma in Computer Science Engineering (Diplôme d’Ingénieur contrôlé par l’État), which is equivalent to a Master Degree. He spent part of his Engineering studies at the Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, where he completed and defended his Master's Thesis. 
Dr Carmona-Moreno moved to Singapore in 2016, where he worked as a Research Engineer in Computer Vision and Machine Learning applied to Robotics. He started his PhD in Robotics in 2018 at the National University of Singapore and completed his doctorate in 2023. 
Dr Carmona-Moreno is currently a Research Fellow at the Biorobotics Laboratory, working on developing novel bio-inspired learning-based planning algorithms for household and space robots..
