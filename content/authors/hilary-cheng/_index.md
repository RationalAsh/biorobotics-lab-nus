Hilary received her B.Eng. in Biomedical Engineering (BME) from The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2017. Afterward, she joined the Mechanical and Automation Engineering Department (MAE), CUHK as a Research Assistant and then an M.Phil. student. Hilary received her M.Phil. in MAE from CUHK in 2020. During her time in the two Engineering departments, she worked on EMG-driven prosthetic finger, shoulder rehabilitation device for stroke, and human shoulder workspace analysis through an anthropomorphic robot model.

With Hilaryâ€™s strong interest in medical-related researches, in 2020, she joined the Department of Orthopaedics & Traumatology (ORT), CUHK as a Research Assistant to gain her clinical experiences at Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. She worked on various elderly and sports rehabilitation projects when she worked in ORT.

Hilary is currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering, NUS under the supervision of Dr. Yu Haoyong. Her research focuses on stroke rehabilitation with robotic devices.
