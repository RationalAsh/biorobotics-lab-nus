# [NUS Biorobotics Lab Website](https://www.example.com)

This is the hugo source code for the NUS Biorobotics Lab website. 

## Information for Maintainers
The website uses the hugo academic theme from wowchemy. The theme documentation can be found [here](https://wowchemy.com). The content for the website is written in Markdown annotated with YAML front matter, and the website is built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static site generator.

### Building the website
To build the website, you will need to install hugo. The hugo installation instructions can be found [here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/). Once you have hugo installed, you can build the website by running `hugo` in the root directory of the repository. The built website will be in the `public` directory.

### Local Development
To preview the website locally run the following command in the root directory of the repository:
```bash
hugo server --watch --disableFastRender
```

### Managing Team Members
Team members are managed in the `content/authors` directory. Each team member has their own markdown file. The markdown file contains the team member's information.
